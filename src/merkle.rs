//! The MeshCore payload merkle tree.
//!
//! Each 1 KB payload block hashes to a 4-byte leaf (`sha2-256:4`); the root is a Merkle-Mountain-Range:
//! leaves are folded into per-level "peaks" like incrementing a binary counter (carry = combine two equal
//! subtrees), then the leftover peaks are bagged **right-to-left** into the final 4-byte root. This must
//! stay byte-identical to `src/helpers/ota/MerkleTree.cpp` in the firmware — the device recomputes the same
//! root to authenticate a fetch, so [`merkle_root`] is pinned by cross-checks against real `.mota` files.
